# Agent Skills
This directory contains deterministic capabilities (tools) that agents can invoke.

## Structure
- **/fundamental**: Financial health checks (SQL queries).
- **/technical**: Price & momentum indicators.
- **/valuation**: P/E, DCF, and relative valuation logic.
- **/sentiment**: News and social media sentiment analysis.
- **/risk**: Volatility and correlation metrics.

Each skill folder should contain a `SKILL.md` manifest and a Python entry point.
