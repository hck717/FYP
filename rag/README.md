# RAG System
This directory encapsulates the retrieval-augmented generation logic.

## Structure
- **/embeddings**: Logic for generating vector embeddings from text.
- **/retrieval**: Hybrid search implementation (combining keyword and semantic search).
- Self-improvement logic (feedback loops) will also reside here.
